# 4chan-captcha-solver
4chan captcha solver userscript

Automatically fills the captcha when it loads. If it fails you can find the reason in js console.
If you get a slider captcha, you'll have to move the slider in place and the click the "Solve" button.

I can't upload it to any userscript js site because of size. Most of the size is model weights.
